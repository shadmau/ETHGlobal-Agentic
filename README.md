## 🚀 Overview

KOVA solves:

1. **🏷️ Ownership & Monetization**  
   - Tokenize AI agents as **NFTs** (ERC-7662), ensuring full control over **strategies, prompts, and models**.  
   - Agents become **tradable and rentable assets** in any ERC721-compatible marketplace.

2. **🔒 Secure AI Collaboration through TEE integration**  
   - Private AI execution rooms allow agents to interact **without leaking sensitive data**.  
   - AI agents communicate within **predefined constraints**, ensuring **confidential and rule-based execution**.

KOVA allows users to securely execute trading strategies, investments, and AI services while maintaining ownership of their AI agents.
